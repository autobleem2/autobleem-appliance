# Sourced by an App's run.sh before it starts its program - the Pi's version of the console's
# rc/app_env.sh. The console's job there is the shared libraries RetroBoot's apps need; a Pi has a
# real distribution underneath it and needs none of that, so what is left here is the virtual gamepad
# (docs/virtual-gamepad-plan.md) and the environment an App is entitled to expect.
#
# An App's run.sh does:
#
#     #!/bin/sh
#     . "$(dirname "$0")/../../Autobleem/rc/app_env.sh"
#     cd "$AB_APP_DIR" || exit 1
#     exec ./the-game
#
# It is sourced, not run, so "$0" here is the *App's* run.sh - which is what lets the data partition
# be found without anything being hardcoded, the same way the other rc scripts find it. An App is
# assumed to live at <root>/Apps/<name>/, which is what the launcher's Apps set means by one.

# Doom announces "Using /root/.local/share/chocolate-doom/ for configuration and saves" - which on a

# less on a Pi or a PC, where the root filesystem is the user's own, but the behaviour is the same
# everywhere on purpose: an App's saves belong beside the games, on the partition that gets backed
# up and carried about, not in a dot-directory of whatever account the launcher happens to run as.

# required: an App whose folder has no pad.ini and a tree with no abpad installed simply run as they
# always did.

# App is exec'd over this shell, which keeps the same pid, and including when the App crashes.

# (arm64) or bin/emu-i386 (the PC stick), put there by pcsx-rearmed-develop's builds - Games/, Apps/) with
# the built parts filled in: the binary and its resources in Autobleem/bin/autobleem, the cover databases in
# Autobleem/bin/db, and Themes/ from autobleem2/autobleem-themes' own release (D5, 2026-09-26 - the same
# tools/release_assets.sh:stage_themes() assemble.sh uses, so a local package gets the same themes a real
# release would; needs `gh` authenticated, or AB_THEMES_DIR=<local autobleem-themes checkout> to copy Themes/
# from disk instead - for a machine with no `gh`). install.sh then copies Autobleem/ Themes/ Games/ Apps/
# onto the exFAT partition as they are - the same install.sh serves every architecture, detecting which at
# runtime (dpkg --print-architecture), and the platform (a Pi or a PC) with it.
#
# DOCS-5 (2026-09-27): payload_linux/, system/ and this script are this repo's own (APPLIANCE below); the
# cross-compiled binary, src/resources, LICENSE/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES and the build's version.h come from a
# separate autobleem2/autobleem launcher checkout (LAUNCHER, default: cwd - run this from inside it):

#   cd /path/to/autobleem && ./make_rpi.sh && \
#     AB_LAUNCHER_DIR="$PWD" /path/to/autobleem-appliance/tools/make_rpi_package.sh
#
# AB_LAUNCHER_DIR overrides the default (the working directory this is invoked from); AB_THEMES_DIR as above.
